## 📖 What is [z2o-k7e](https://learn.z2o-k7e.world)?

[z2o-k7e](https://learn.z2o-k7e.world) is a community-driven project dedicated to collaborative ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proof) studies and creation. In three terms zkp learning journey since February 2023, we've explored resources like <https://www.zkiap.com>, <https://zk-learning.org>, [write PLONK protocol with plonkathon](https://github.com/0xPARC/plonkathon) , and [0xPARC halo2(ongoing)](https://learn.0xparc.org/halo2), engaging with over 300+ enthusiastic participants!

In this journey, our vibrant community learns collectively, assists one another with q-a, and write zkp-related content collaboratively.

At [z2o-k7e](https://learn.z2o-k7e.world), we award bounties to motivate learners for their tech insights, encourage active community maintenance, and promote the organization of ZKP-centric knowledge. Collectively, our mission is to enhance the quality of **ZKP Public Goods**.

🚀 Now we're gearing up to roll out advanced content for zk-learning.org, including intriguing topics like Nova, STARK, and beyond.

## 🚩 Problem Statement:

The world of ZKP is riddled with challenges - so many noises, steep entry barriers, convoluted learning processes, an absence of dedicated learning communities, and a deluge of often nebulous information. Through **[z2o-k7e](https://learn.z2o-k7e.world)** & zkp-colearning community, we're committed to confronting and tackling these issues head-on.
